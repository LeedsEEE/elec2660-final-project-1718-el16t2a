 The application i created is an idea that can be adopt it by restaurants.
i chose the example of a restaurant in leeds called byron.
 the application has 3 tabs :
 the first one shows the menu of the restaurant (taken from : https://www.byronhamburgers.com/ )
 the second one lets the waiter to enter the bill details, and to have the amount split between payers.
 the third one shows information about the waiter and has a notes pad where he can leave notes related to work. it also has information about the restaurant, its location and its website
